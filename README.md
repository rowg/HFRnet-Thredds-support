This repository contains scripts for accessing data from the [HFRnet TDS](https://hfrnet-tds.ucsd.edu) surface current archive hosted at [Coastal Observing Research and Development Center Scripps Institution of Oceanography](https://cordc.ucsd.edu).

There are examples for Python, Matlab and R. The Python and Matlab scripts are supported, however the R scripts are not. Please contact
